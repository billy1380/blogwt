# ![Blogwt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/billy1380/blogwt/master/src/main/resources/com/willshex/blogwt/client/res/brand.png "Blogwt") BloGWT

Looking for a better name! Let me know if you have one :wink:.

##Intro
This project is a blog written in GWT on top of app engine. I started this project because I wanted a blog site for my [willshex.com](http://www.willshex.com "willshex.com") domain. The project does not use gwtrpc, I am using a json based API (or 4 - search, user, blog, and page split by functional area).

##Incomplete
There are things missing from the project, but I am working on it everyday, and making good progress too.

I am also adding things that I think I might need as I go along, so if you think there is something useful that you would like to request, please, raise an issue if there isn't one there yet.

I will put a road map shortly on the wiki, maybe even with a "how to".

##Demo
I have previously had issues with discrepancies between the appengine sdk behaviour and production so to use for testing and also for demo purposes I there is a relatively up to date version of the project running __[here](http://blogwtproject.appspot.com "Blogwt demo")__ so go have a look.

## Dependencies
The [issue](https://github.com/billy1380/blogwt/issues/21) with the missing dependencies has now been resolved - in that they are all now on github. I will put some instructions together shortly.
